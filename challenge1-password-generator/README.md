# STEPS OF THE SOLUTION

## Algorithm used
The program starts by importing the necessary modules, random and string, to generate random characters and work with strings.

The generate_password function is defined. It takes an optional length parameter, which specifies the desired length of the password. By default, the length is set to 8.

Different character categories are defined: uppercase_letters, lowercase_letters, digits, and symbols. These categories contain the corresponding characters from the string module.

The all_characters list is created by combining all the characters from the different categories.

To ensure that the generated password meets the minimum length requirement, the length variable is checked. If it's less than 8, it is set to 8.

The random.choices function is used to randomly select characters from the all_characters list. The k parameter specifies how many characters to choose, which is equal to the length of the password.

The resulting list of characters is joined together using the str.join method to form a string representing the generated password.

The password is then validated using the any() function and the corresponding methods (isupper(), islower(), isdigit(), and checking if a character is in string.punctuation). It checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one symbol character.

If the password meets the requirements, it is returned. Otherwise, the default "Invalid password, validation fails" is returned.

In the main part of the program, the user is prompted to enter the desired password length.

The generate_password function is called with the provided length, and the resulting password is stored in the password variable.

The generated password is then printed to the console.


# Assumptions
The code assumes that the user will enter a valid integer value for the desired password length when prompted.
It is assumed that the generated password will be printed to the console for the user to see.
The validation check assumes that the password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one symbol character. If any of these requirements is not met, the password is considered invalid.
The generate_password function assumes that the length parameter passed to it is a positive integer representing the desired length of the password.
